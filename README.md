# Module-2-challenge

## Description
This website holds information about me and how to contact me. It also holds 5 projects for potential employers to view. It was designed based on a mockup show by university of toronto coding bootcamp.
The websites primary function is to show employers my projects and my information.
A portfolio is essential to a software engineer's career as it serves to show what your abilities as a developer. [webpage screenshot](/assets/project-portfolio_erickrenaud05.github.io.jpeg) 

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
In the header you can click on the links to go directly to the sections the indicate. The resume link will be added once I have a proper resume. Same as the work section, as of right now, clicking on the images only brings you to the top of the page, once I have projects, I will implement the images as links to the project webpage. The contact me section has my number and email with a one click select option for easy copy pasting. Visit the website at https://erickrenaud05.github.io/project-portfolio/.
